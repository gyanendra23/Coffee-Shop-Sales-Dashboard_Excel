# Coffee-Shop-Sales-Dashboard_Excel
This project analyzes coffee shop sales data to uncover key business insights and create an interactive Power BI dashboard. The analysis helps track sales performance, customer behavior, product trends, and location-based performance.

🛑 Problem Statement

The coffee shop chain faced challenges in understanding:

Which products contribute the most to revenue

Peak customer hours and demand patterns

Size-wise and location-wise sales contribution

Weekly sales consistency

Without these insights, it was difficult to optimize operations, marketing strategies, and inventory management.

✅ Solution

I developed a Power BI dashboard that provides:

Top product sales analysis

Hourly, daily, and weekly demand trends

Size-wise contribution breakdown

Footfall vs. sales comparison by location

Customer purchase behavior insights

📊 Key Insights

Total Sales: $6,98,812 from 149,116+ footfall (Avg. Bill = $4.69)

Top Product: Barista Espresso ($91K)

Orders peak between 8–10 AM

Large & Regular sizes contribute 62%+ of total sales

Hell’s Kitchen had the highest sales ($236K) despite similar footfall

Sales remain consistent across weekdays
